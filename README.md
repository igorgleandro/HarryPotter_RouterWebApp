Harry Potter Fandom - RouterWebApp
Mar  2024

It is my first RouterApp, so it is using Spring and MVC, Bootstrap, also JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is using an API from https://hp-api.onrender.com.

You can randomly be sorted into a Hogwarts House, search for your favorite Harry Potter character by name, or apply a house filter. The cards will then provide more information about the character. Additionally, you can search for all spells and their effects.
